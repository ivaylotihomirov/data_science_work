    "# Analyzing Employees Exit Surveys\n",

    "This project will aim to analyze employees exit surveys. Data comes from exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will aim to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?"
