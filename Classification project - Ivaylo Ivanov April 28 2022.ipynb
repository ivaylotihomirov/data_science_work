    "Supervised learning algorithms rely on some predefined labeling of data, which is used for the discovery of patterns. By contrast, unsupervised learning is a family of algorithms, which do not rely on labeling of data - the algorithm itself discovers the labeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to classification vs regression, regression tries to predict the value for a certain variable, whereas classification tries to predict the category which the observation would fall into. In some cases, it is more difficult to draw a line between classification and regression, as classification just involves regression with a threshold, which is used to delineate between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems which classification can solve directly are linked to the need to distinguish between classes directly - for example, the famous Titanic competition on Kaggle, which aims for participants to predict whether passengers would survive based on a number of characteristics - passenger class, gender, age, etc. By contrast, there are other problems, which can be reduced to classification - for example, email spam filters, which rely on classification of emails into \"spam\" vs \"ham\".  \n",

    "Binary, or two-class classification, involves classification and prediction involving only 2 categories - for example, we can classify if the predicted value is 0 or 1 (as in Logistic Regression). Usually, the 0 vs 1 is encoding for an underlying variable. Multi-class classification involves classifying an observation into 1 of multiple classes - an example of such problems is face recognition - we have (much) more than 2 categories, or classes to classify a person.\n",
